The efforts of the European payments industry have not proven sufficient to ensure a high uptake of instant credit transfers in euro at Union level. Only a widespread and rapid increase in such uptake could unlock the full-scale network effects of instant credit transfers in euro, leading to benefits and economic efficiency gains for payment service users (PSUs) and PSPs, reduced market concentration, and increased competition and choice of electronic payments, in particular for cross-border payments at the POI.</p>

The differences among those national regulatory solutions pose a risk of fragmentation of the internal market that would result in the increase of compliance costs due to different sets of national regulatory requirements and a more difficult execution of cross-border instant credit transfers. Uniform rules on instant credit transfers in euro, including cross-border instant credit transfers, should therefore be introduced to prevent such obstacles from arising.</p>

However, in retail payment systems currently used to process instant credit transfers in euro, payment transactions are submitted individually and processed round the clock and in real time. To reflect that, it is necessary to amend the definition of the term ‘retail payment system’ in Regulation (EU) No 260/2012.</p>

Currently, at least one third of PSPs in the Union do not offer the payment service of sending and receiving instant credit transfers in euro. Moreover, the rate at which PSPs have been introducing instant credit transfers into their range of services has been, over the last few years, too slow, which hinders further integration of the internal market, undermines the Union’s open strategic autonomy and limits potential benefits for PSUs. Therefore, PSPs providing the payment service of sending and receiving credit transfers in euro to their PSUs should be required to offer the payment service of sending and receiving instant credit transfers in euro to all of their PSUs. That requirement should apply with respect to all payment accounts which PSPs maintain for their PSUs, including payment accounts with basic features referred to in Directive 2014/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc5-L_202400886EN.000101-E0005" href="#ntr5-L_202400886EN.000101-E0005"

The level of charges can therefore steer them towards or away from a given payment method. In national markets where higher transaction-level charges for instant credit transfers in euro have been applied, when compared to charges for other credit transfers in euro, the uptake of instant credit transfers is low. That has prevented the attainment of the critical mass of instant credit transfers in euro that is necessary to realise the full network effects for both PSPs and PSUs. Therefore, all types of charges applied to payers and payees for the execution of instant credit transfers in euro, including per-transaction charges or lump-sum charges, should not exceed such charges applied to the same PSU for corresponding types of other credit transfers in euro. It would be undesirable that PSPs circumvent the aim of that requirement. When identifying corresponding types of credit transfers, it should be possible to use criteria including the payment initiation channel or the payment instrument used to initiate the payment, customer status, and additional features or services.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">Ubiquitous instant credit transfers in euro offer opportunities for PSPs to develop new payment solutions, such as mobile payment applications, facilitating the use of instant credit transfers in euro for payments at the POI. Such payment solutions could include additional features or services offered to payers and payees, such as payment initiation, dispute resolution or refunds. PSPs should be able to decide on the charges for such additional features or services on top of the underlying instant credit transfer. An instant-credit-transfer-based payment solution encompassing additional features or services should not be considered to be of corresponding nature to a non-instant credit transfer offered without the same additional features or services. Where it is possible for a PSU to submit payment orders for non-instant credit transfers without any additional features or services, the same possibility should also be available for instant credit transfers in euro. It should be ensured that, from the PSU’s perspective, it is not more expensive to send or receive an instant credit transfer in euro than it is to send or receive a non-instant credit transfer in euro provided with the same additional features or services. In particular, PSPs offering different variants of a payment solution where the only distinguishing characteristic between them would be the use of instant credit transfers in one and non-instant in the other, should ensure that the total charge for the instant credit transfer in euro variant is not higher than the charge for the non-instant credit transfer in euro variant.</p>

Under Directive (EU) 2015/2366, the only determinant of the correct execution of the transaction with respect to the payee is the unique identifier, as defined in that Directive, and PSPs are not required to verify the name of the payee. PSPs should have in place robust and up-to-date fraud detection and prevention measures, designed to prevent a credit transfer from being sent to an unintended payee as a result of fraud or error, given that it might not be possible for the payer to recover the funds before those funds are credited to the payee’s account. PSPs should have a certain degree of flexibility in designing the most suitable measures for dealing with different payment initiation options. Such measures should not result in PSUs incurring any additional charges or fees. PSPs should therefore provide a service ensuring verification of the payee to whom the payer intends to send a credit transfer (service ensuring verification). To avoid undue friction or delays in the processing of the transaction, the payer’s PSP should perform such service immediately after the payer provides the relevant information about the payee and before the payer is offered the possibility of authorising the credit transfer.</p>

PSPs should not be held liable for the execution of a transaction to an unintended payee on the basis of an incorrect unique identifier, as laid down in Article 88 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, insofar as PSPs correctly perform the service ensuring verification. However, where PSPs, including payment initiation service providers, fail to correctly perform such service and where such failure results in a defectively executed payment transaction, such PSPs should refund the payer the transferred amount without delay and, where applicable, restore the debited payment account to the state in which it would have been had the payment transaction not taken place. PSPs should inform PSUs of the implications for PSP liability and PSU refund rights of the choice of the PSUs to ignore a notification provided in accordance with this amending Regulation.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">It is of critical importance that PSPs comply effectively with their obligations stemming from restrictive measures adopted by the Union in accordance with Article 215 TFEU in respect of a person, body or entity that is subject to an asset freeze or a prohibition on making funds or economic resources available to it, or for its benefit, either directly or indirectly (targeted financial restrictive measures). Union law, however, does not lay down rules on the procedure or tools to be used by PSPs to ensure their compliance with those obligations. PSPs thus apply various methods, based on their individual choice or on the guidance provided by the national authorities concerned. The practice of complying with obligations stemming from targeted financial restrictive measures by screening the payer and the payee involved in each credit transfer transaction, whether national or cross-border, leads to a very high number of credit transfers being flagged as potentially involving persons or entities subject to targeted financial restrictive measures. However, the large majority of such flagged transactions turn out, after verification, not to involve any of the persons or entities subject to targeted financial restrictive measures. Due to the nature of instant credit transfers, it is impossible for PSPs to verify, within the required short time limit, those flagged transactions and, as a result, they are rejected. That situation creates operational challenges for PSPs to offer the payment service of sending and receiving instant credit transfers to their PSUs across the Union in a reliable and predictable way. To provide for greater legal certainty, to increase the efficiency of PSPs’ efforts to comply, in the context of instant credit transfers in euro, with their obligations stemming from targeted financial restrictive measures and to prevent unnecessary hindering of sending and receiving instant credit transfers, PSPs should periodically, and at least daily, verify whether their PSUs are persons or entities subject to targeted financial restrictive measures, and should no longer apply transaction-based screening in that specific context. The obligation of PSPs to periodically verify their PSUs is related only to persons or entities subject to targeted financial restrictive measures. Other types of restrictive measures adopted in accordance with Article 215 TFEU or restrictive measures that are not adopted in accordance with Article 215 TFEU fall outside the scope of that obligation.</p>

                           <p class="oj-normal">PSPs need sufficient time to meet the obligations laid down in this amending Regulation. It is therefore appropriate to introduce those obligations gradually, allowing PSPs a more efficient use of their resources. The obligation to offer the payment service of sending instant credit transfers should therefore apply later, preceded by the obligation to offer the payment service of receiving instant credit transfers, since the sending of instant credit transfers tends to be the more costly and complex of the two services to implement and therefore necessitates more time for its implementation. The service ensuring verification is relevant for PSPs offering the payment service of sending credit transfers.</p>
                           <p class="oj-normal">The obligation to offer the service ensuring verification should therefore apply from the same time as the obligation to offer the payment service of sending instant credit transfers. The obligations related to charges and harmonised procedure to ensure compliance with obligations stemming from targeted financial restrictive measures should apply as soon as PSPs are obliged to offer the payment service of receiving instant credit transfers. To allow PSPs located in Member States whose currency is not the euro to efficiently allocate the resources needed for the implementation of instant credit transfers in euro, the obligations laid down in this amending Regulation should apply to such PSPs as of later dates than to PSPs located in Member States whose currency is the euro. The introduction of the various obligations should be gradual as in the case of PSPs located in the euro area. If the euro is introduced as the currency of a Member State whose currency is not the euro before those later dates, the PSPs in that Member State should comply with this amending Regulation within one year of joining the euro area and not later than the respective dates specified for PSPs in Member States whose currency is not the euro. However, such PSPs should be able to comply with this amending Regulation earlier than the respective dates specified for PSPs in Member States whose currency is the euro.</p>
